Notes for user:
NEED NUMPY TO RUN
This repository consists of 3 different actions:

game.py is a standalone minesweeper game. When run, you may select the number of rows, columns, and bombs 
for your game, and play it accordingly. I do not recommend more ~10x10 board, or it will go off screen

hardcoded_ai.py runs an AI that solves a 4x4 board with 2 bombs by default. It uses a simple
probability matrix to determine which square to select. The game is dependant on gameforai_2.py
There are a couple bugs, it can only solve the board about ~50% of the time. Cannot solve larger
boards. Although you can edit the size of the board at the bottom of the file, it doesn't do a very
good job however with bigger boards.

ai.py is trained using a genetic algorithm and neural network. It is dependant on:

gameforai.py
nn.py
ga.py
matrix2d.py

By default, it runs 25 epochs on 100 random 4x4 boards with 2 bombs in each, and outputs the final solution 
from the network to the console and the total scores from each generation. I have yet to see it sucessfully
solve the board.
